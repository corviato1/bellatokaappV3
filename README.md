## Bugs & Problems!
* 


## TO DO:
* /home seach button needs to also have a "click to scan your product".  That button will open camera so user can scan qr code.
* Functional password for admin page
* Update "PENDING" Our Pillars on /about
* Update "More Info" Our Pillars on /about
* Update Links to Learn Our Pillars on /about (not a priority)

* /admin needs to display the weekly tasks, and the monthly tasks in /facility. It needs to be more user fiendly.

* /facility is all messed up.  it needs to represent the front of house for anyone visitng the site.  It should show tasks that have happened, and other general stats about the facility.  The design is to pull in users with insightful information and display.

* workflow for plant location:  Admin page API into metrc to update data.  Home page to metrc API to display content.  Review security standards to protect pipeline

* connect data with supabase
